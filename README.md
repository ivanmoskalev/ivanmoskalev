Hi, I'm Ivan! I enjoy solving problems and exploring new ideas.

I'm currently working on VK Messenger for iOS, focusing on updating the network stack, refining databases, and improving performance.

Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, such as Yandex.Translate for iOS, Punto Switcher, and the Yandex Superapp. This involved, in no particular order: porting a C++ machine translation engine for mobiles, working with OCR and live translation technologies, creating a watchOS app, pushing monthly releases to 5M+ MAU, refactoring C++03 codebases, setting up TeamCity pipelines, and having lots of fun. 

My time at Yandex also led me to develop and patent a user interface solution (System, method and user interface for gesture-based scheduling of computer tasks; US 20160224202 A1). Someone later implemented it, cool to see the idea working! 

After Yandex I've worked at Kaspersky Lab Startup Incubator, where I helped create an anti-counterfeit and augmented reality system that used NFC/RFID scanning, and contributed to building a cross-platform full-stack mobile team. The solutions we built were in use by 3M, Moncler and helped Thebe Magugu make a dashing presentation that secured him LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize.

I'm always open to learning new things and sharing my knowledge with the development community.
