Hi, I'm Ivan! I enjoy solving problems and exploring new ideas.

I'm currently working on VK Messenger for iOS, focusing on improving the network stack, refining databases, and in general measuring and optimizing the app's performance.

Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, such as Yandex.Translate for iOS, Punto Switcher, and the Yandex Superapp. This involved, in no particular order: porting a C++ machine translation engine for mobiles, working with OCR and live translation technologies, creating a watchOS app, pushing releases to 5M MAU, refactoring C++03 codebases, setting up complex TeamCity pipelines, and having lots of fun. 

My time at Yandex also led me to develop and patent a user interface solution (System, method and user interface for gesture-based scheduling of computer tasks; US 20160224202 A1). Someone later implemented it, cool to see the idea working! 

After Yandex I've worked at Kaspersky Lab Startup Incubator, where I helped create an anti-counterfeit system that used NFC/RFID. The solutions we built were in use by 3M, Moncler and, surprising as it is, helped Thebe Magugu make a dashing presentation that secured him LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize.

I'm quite bad at mathemathics. My priorities in programming and tech are primarily humanitarian, and I enjoy concrete, pragmatic yet deeply empathic solutions.

I'm always open to learning new things and sharing my findings with the development community!
